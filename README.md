# Nanopore-RNAseq
This repository provides a workflow for Nanopore RNA-Seq analysis, including transcriptome alignment, event alignment, and m6A modification detection.

# Tools:
1. **Minimap2:** For genome alignment.
2. **Samtools:** For BAM file processing (view, sort, index).
3. **Nanopolish:** For event alignment and base calling.
4. **M6ANet:** For detecting m6A modifications.

# Acknowledgements
Thanks to the developers of Minimap2, Samtools, Nanopolish, and M6ANet for their open-source tools that made this analysis possible.
